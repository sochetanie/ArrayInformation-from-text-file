The file numbers.text contains a header value, followed by that many double values. Create an array of the appropriate size, populate the array with the doubles, and print out various information about the array (see below).

The name of your class should be ArrayInfo.

For example, if the file numbers.text contains:

8<br />
12.3<br />
2.5<br />
9.4<br />
3.14<br />
22.15<br />
17<br />
54.3<br />
7.6<br />
the program should produce the following output:

The array: {12.3, 2.5, 9.4, 3.14, 22.15, 17.0, 54.3, 7.6} contains 8 elements<br />
The first element of the array is 12.3<br />
The last element of the array is 7.6 and is at position 7<br />
The middle element of the array is 3.14 and is at position 3<br />
The largest element of the array is 54.3 and is at position 6<br />
The smallest element of the array is 2.5 and is at position 1<br />
